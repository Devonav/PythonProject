For the my integration project I will have a combination of code that displays what i learned in this class.
The user will enter their name to begin the program and enter multiple different whole numbers in the program. After
those whole numbers are entered the user has a choice to use any operator from the display menu to calculate those two
numbers.The program also contains a range counter and
code that tells you to input a 4 digit year to determine if its a leap year or not.
